Notes on how I set up Python on my M2 Macbook Air. This is one of those posts that is more for my own records but here it is.

## Prerequisites:

### 1. Install Command Line Developer Tools

- Open Terminal and type

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

- The following prompt will show up asking if you would like to install the tools now.
![XCode Popup](/images/xcode_select.png "XCode Popup")
- After it installs type this command in the Terminal

```bash
xcode-select -p
```

- The response should be

```bash
% /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
```




### Step 1: Install Homebrew
- https://brew.sh

``` bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```


Run these two commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your **PATH** (Homebrew gives these commands to you after installation):

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/lukegrippa/.zprofile

eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```


Check if Homebrew is installed correctly

```bash
brew doctor
```


Terminal should respond

```bash
% Your system is ready to brew.
```




### Step 2: Install Pyenv

```bash
brew install pyenv
```


To update in the future use

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade pyenv
```


Add three lines to your configuration file

1. This  line sets an environment variable (`PYENV_ROOT`) that points to the pyenv directory.

```bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zprofile
```


2. This line puts pyenv first in your search path so that the OS will find pyenv’s Python(s) before any other Pythons.

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zprofile
```


3. This line initializes pyenv each time you open a terminal.

```bash
echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.zprofile
```




### Step 3: Install Python Versions
- https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md


Before installing python I want to install a couple of packages

```bash
brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib
```


Check which version are available

```bash
pyenv install -l

pyenv install --list
```


Install latest version

```bash
pyenv install 3.10.5
```


Rehash Python binaries

```bash
pyenv rehash
```


Check which versions you have downloaded

```bash
pyenv versions
```


Set Global version of Python

```bash
pyenv global 3.10.5
```


Uninstall a version of Python

```bash
pyenv uninstall 3.10.5
```
